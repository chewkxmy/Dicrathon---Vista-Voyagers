75,Blank Canvas,"Blank Canvas is an independent contemporary arts platform which opened in 2022 in George Town, Penang. While modest in space, it is nevertheless ambitious in its twin aspirations.

Taking inspiration from its location within","a UNESCO World Heritage site, Blank Canvas seeks to be a bridge between a richly historical city and its broader environs and the international contemporary art world. It aims to promote greater awareness and appreciation in the region of both local and international contemporary art, and also to encourage international contemporary art practitioners to discover and engage with Penang and the region.

More expansively, Blank Canvas also aspires to be a springboard for exploring, and challenging, the twin fundamental notions of what is art and what can be art. In addition to the conventional visual forms of painting and sculpture, Blank Canvas is eager to explore other media such as photography, performance, installation, sound, and even psychology aka mind games, as well as other experiences heretofore unencountered.

To these ends, this eponymous space is a blank slate. It is continually looking for different ways to serve contemporary art and its constituents – the audience and the artists – as an art gallery, an incubator, a residency, a dialogue venue, and more.

On this journey of exploration and evolution, Blank Canvas is guided by the ethos of collaboration. It is humble in acknowledging that it has to engage widely and deeply with the myriad members of the art community to be effective. But it is also confident that it has something to offer to the art community in return.",5.420125,100.3349776,"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3971.979270560006!2d100.3375525!3d5.420119700000003!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x304ac3a972b372a3%3A0xf68b245543357c52!2sBlank%20Canvas!5e0!3m2!1sms!2smy!4v1729924353378!5m2!1sms!2smy"" width=""600"" height=""450"" style=""border:0;"" allowfullscreen="""" loading=""lazy"" referrerpolicy=""no-referrer-when-downgrade","2, Lorong Argus, George Town, 10200 George Town, Pulau Pinang",Closed,Closed,Closed,Closed,12:00 pm-7:00 pm,12:00 pm-7:00 pm,12:00 pm-7:00 pm,016-2466814,Arts and Culture,Free,Indoor,4.8,http://www.blankcanvas.my/,https://blankcanvas.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2.-E2_Space_4_V01_2.jpg,1,20/1/2025 14:55,1

84,Penang Peranakan Mansion,"The Peranakans, also known as the Babas and Nyonyas, was a prominent community of acculturated Chinese unique to this part of the world, especially in the Straits Settlements (Penang, Malacca and Singapore) hence its other nam","e, the Straits Chinese. Adopting selected ways of the local Malays and later, the colonial British, the Peranakans had created a unique lifestyle and customs which had not only left behind a rich legacy of antiques but its cultural influences like cuisine and language are still evident in Penang today.

At the Pinang Peranakan Mansion, the typical home of a rich Baba of a century ago is recreated to offer a glimpse of their opulent lifestyle and of their many customs and traditions. With over 1,000 pieces of antiques and collectibles of the era on display, this Baba-Nyonya museum is also housed in one of Penangï¿½s heritage mansion of eclectic design and architecture. Built at the end of the 19th century by one of local historyï¿½s famous personalities, the ï¿½Hai Kee Chanï¿½ or Sea Remembrance Store had once served as the residence and office of Kapitan Cina Chung Keng Kwee. Though not a Baba himself, his Chinese courtyard house was much like a typical large Baba home of eclectic style, incorporating Chinese carved-wood panels and English floor tiles and Scottish ironworks. Having survived the many decades of neglect and decay, the mansion has now been restored to its former glory of a stately home.",5.4178275,100.3386297,"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d15887.97738069813!2d100.33090484517794!3d5.417827412981466!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x304ac38fdcf36b09%3A0x8b7cdd7809de1be6!2sPinang%20Peranakan%20Mansion!5e0!3m2!1sen!2smy!4v1730015310077!5m2!1sen!2smy"" width=""600"" height=""450"" style=""border:0;"" allowfullscreen="""" loading=""lazy"" referrerpolicy=""no-referrer-when-downgrade","29, Church Street, 10200 George Town, Penang",9:30 am–5:00 pm,9:30 am–5:00 pm,9:30 am–5:00 pm,9:30 am–5:00 pm,9:30 am–5:00 pm,9:30 am–5:00 pm,9:30 am–5:00 pm,04-2642929,Unique Landmark and Experiences,"Adults : RM25.00

Though not a Baba himself, his Chinese courtyard house was much like a typical large Baba home of eclectic style, incorporating Chinese carved-wood panels and English floor tiles and Scottish ironworks.
